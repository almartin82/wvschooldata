## CRITICAL DATA SOURCE RULES

**NEVER use Urban Institute API, NCES CCD, or ANY federal data source** — the entire point of these packages is to provide STATE-LEVEL data directly from state DOEs. Federal sources aggregate/transform data differently and lose state-specific details. If a state DOE source is broken, FIX IT or find an alternative STATE source — do not fall back to federal data.
